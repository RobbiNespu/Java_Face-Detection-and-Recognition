# Java_Face-Detection-and-Recognition

Final Year Project in INTI International University Malaysia

Algorithm:
Face Detection: Haar Cascades
Feature Extraction: Principle Component Analysis 
Face Recognition: Eigenfaces

Study and Implementation of Automated Face Detection and Recognition for Camera Surveillance Using openCV and JAVA language

Construct Eigenfaces
Steps
1.Grayscale Face Images
2.A “STOP” Exposure
3.Calculate Eigenfaces(Corresponding to largest Eigenvalue)
Dataset training

Face Recognition Steps:
1.Automatically Crop Face Images
2.Grayscale and Resize Face images to 220 * 220 pixel
3.Feature Extraction and Calculate distance 
4.Distance below 0.2 can be identified as same person

Image Face Recognition
1.Steps of Face Recognition from image
2.Load Face Image
3.Grayscale, a “STOP” Exposure and Resize
4.Face Detection using Haar Cascades
5.Feature Extraction using PCA
6.Calculate Eigenvalues and Similarity
7.Retrieve results from Face Database

System Strength
Fast Face Detection and Recognition within seconds
